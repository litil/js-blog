We haven’t covered this yet so it’s okay if you’re not sure. Try to answer it using your current knowledge of JavaScript. Now I want you to take a few moments and write down your exact thinking process for each line of this code, step by step. Pay attention to any gaps or uncertainties in your existing mental model, and write them down too. If you have any doubts about it, try to articulate them as clearly as you can."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/02-javascript-universe","categorySlug":"/category/js-courses/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"02.

This is like asking what a number is in math, or what a point is in geometry. A value is a thing in the JavaScript universe. Numbers are values — but so are a few other things, like objects and functions. However, many things, such as an if statement or a variable declaration, are not values."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/01-mental-models","categorySlug":"/category/js-courses/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"01.
